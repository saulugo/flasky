I am learning Web App development following the book "Flask Web Development: developing web applications with Python" by Miguel Grinberg. This repo is to store all code I write following this book

The following are my notes from the book:

WORKFLOW WITH FLASK, PYTHON AND GIT

1) Install Python

2) Create a repo in github for the project

3) Clone the repo into the develpment computer
   git clone <path to the github repo>

4) Add the project files to the local repo (note: DO NOT ADD the Flask and
Python files)

       git add <filename>

5) Commit the files and changes to the local repo
   
   git commit -m "message for the commit"

6) Push the changes to the remote (github) repo

   git push origin master
